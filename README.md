# Roll-a-Ball Game

Roll-a-Ball Game

This is a 3D game where the player controls a sphere to navigate through a play forming course, collecting pickups and avoiding obstacles to get to the finish line without falling in lava. The game was created using Unity during my time in university.

How to Play
To play the game, simply run the executable file included in the repository. Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to control the sphere and reach the finish line. Be careful not to fall off the edge of the course or land in the lava, or you will have to start over!

Development
This game was developed using Unity, a popular game engine for creating 2D and 3D games. I used C# programming language to write the scripts that control the gameplay mechanics, such as the sphere movement, camera movement, and collision detection.

The game features dynamic lighting and shadow effects, realistic physics, and sound effects. It also includes a simple user interface with a main menu, pause menu, and game over screen.

Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to improve the game by adding more levels with different challenges and obstacles. I also plan to enhance the graphics and add more sound effects to create a more immersive experience for the player.
